This project is designed to show some of the capabilities of a dynamically built website. Using primarily Javascript, although some HTML and CSS was used as well, content was created dynamically using the static content already present. These skills are important as they can minimize how much time in the long run is spent updating information on a website and also making a website more interesting.

# Demo-Preview

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Scrolling through the different sections on the webpage will trigger 'active' states depending on which section is in current viewport. The process will cause a change in the background color and highlight the current section on the navbar
indicating the section in view. In addition, clicking on any of the list options on the navbar will scroll that section into view.
