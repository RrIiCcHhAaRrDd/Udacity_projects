      <article> Finally! The cracks are starting to show in the Royal Family's thinly veiled attempt to mask their true
        reptilian form. The royals have long been known to be
        descendants of an ancient reptilian race, possibly from the same planet as the home to the scientologist diety
        "Xenu". For generations, they have been amassing
        great wealth and power and have learned, albeit in a crude interpretation, to take the human form. But now eye
        witnesses have now confirmed the long known fact of their
        ability to scale walls, confirmed by no other than Queen Elizabeth herself.

        <q id="quote_1"> She was climbing the banquet walls of Buckingham palace!</q>

        <section class="article_p2">
          The eyewitness to this event states it happened on one of their "regular visits" to Buckingham Palace in which
          they perform a special advisory role for the royal family.
          The witness recounts that whilst briefing Prince Charles on the latest developments with the New World Order,
          he noticed something "quite peculiar." In the background to their meeting
          the witness claims he saw no other than Queen Elizabeth, but 30 feet above their heads! "She was climbing the
          banquet walls of Buckingham palace!"
          The source of this bombshell would rather not be named for fear of a retaliation from the monarchy, but has
          assured us that they posses many more "mind-altering facts
          that give new shape to this thing we call life".

        <section class="article_p3">
          What are the true motivations of this reptilian species, is it world domination? In need of a host species to
          lay their eggs in? The answer has still not revealed itself to us,
          however, the clues may have already been laid out before us just waiting to be deciphered and in my new and
          groundbreaking book "Children of the Matrix", available online and in (select) retail stores,
          I do just that.
